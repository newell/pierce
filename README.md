# Pierce Oscillator

A [Pierce oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_oscillator) is a type of electronic oscillator circuit used to generate continuous sine wave signals at a desired frequency. It is commonly used in crystal oscillators and microcontroller clock circuits due to its excellent frequency stability and accuracy.

The Pierce oscillator employs a quartz crystal resonator as its frequency-determining element. Here's a general description of the Pierce oscillator's operation:

1. **Quartz Crystal Resonator**: The key component in a Pierce oscillator is a quartz crystal resonator. The quartz crystal provides a high-quality resonant circuit that determines the oscillator's frequency. The crystal is cut and manufactured to resonate at a specific frequency.

2. **Active Device**: An active device, such as a transistor or operational amplifier (op-amp), is used for amplification and compensating for energy losses in the oscillator circuit.

3. **Feedback**: The feedback network in a Pierce oscillator typically consists of capacitors and resistors connected to the quartz crystal resonator. The feedback network is designed to provide the necessary phase shift and gain for sustained oscillations.

4. **Biasing**: The active device requires appropriate biasing to operate in its active region. Biasing is accomplished using a separate biasing circuit, typically involving resistors and/or capacitors, to set the operating point of the active device.

5. **Frequency Control**: The frequency of oscillation in a Pierce oscillator is primarily determined by the characteristics of the quartz crystal resonator. The resonant frequency of the crystal is typically specified by the crystal manufacturer and remains highly stable over temperature and other environmental factors.

When the Pierce oscillator is powered on, the active device amplifies the signal generated by the quartz crystal resonator, and the feedback network provides the necessary phase shift and gain for sustained oscillations at the resonant frequency of the crystal. The output signal is typically taken from the amplifier's output.

Pierce oscillators are known for their excellent frequency stability, accuracy, and low phase noise. They are commonly used in applications where precise and stable frequency generation is crucial, such as in microcontrollers, communication systems, and timing devices.
